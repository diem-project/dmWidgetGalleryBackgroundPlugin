dmWidgetGalleryPlugin packages a Diem front widget for displaying image galleries.  Instead of adding them to an in page slideshow, the jQuery Superzied plugin is used to render the slideshow as fullscreen background slideshow.

Adds a gallery background widget to the front Add menu.
It allows to build image galleries and slideshows without writing a line of code.
Images are sortable, commentable and linkable.
The plugin is fully extensible. Only works with [Diem 5.0](http://diem-project.org/) installed.
